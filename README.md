# fintech-labs

This repository contains hands-on experiments and Jupyter notebooks focused on financial data analysis, quantitative indicators, and early-stage trading research using Python.

The goal of this project is to explore how market data can be ingested, analyzed, and transformed into signals using reproducible workflows and clean code practices. It serves both as a learning environment and as a technical sandbox for validating ideas before moving them into production-grade systems.

## Topics covered
- Market data import and cleaning (CSV, APIs)
- Time series analysis with pandas
- Returns, volatility, and basic statistics
- Technical indicators (moving averages, momentum, etc.)
- Signal generation and visualization
- Exploratory backtesting concepts
- Data quality validation and preprocessing

## Tech stack
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib / seaborn (visualization)
- Optional: yfinance / external data providers

## 🔹 If you want it slightly more “senior / product-oriented”

Tell me and I’ll tighten the language to sound more like:
- Quant engineer
- FinTech backend
- Data engineer
- Trading systems

We can tune the tone depending on the role you want to attract.
